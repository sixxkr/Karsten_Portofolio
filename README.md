This is a project I did for my Mobile Application Programming course at university, where I built a classification model for heart disease that was implemented into a mobile application.

* Data was taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
* The Model using Random forest
* For making this mobile app, I using flutter framework
* I using local API To Integrate mobile app with model machine learning using flask
